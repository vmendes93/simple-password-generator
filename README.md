# Password Generator for Python

A simple, trivial, password generator for Python. A simple program that gives you a password with default length of 8 characters. It also gives you an option to chose the length of the password.

## How to use it

Download the files and execute the *main.py* script on your terminal or command prompt. It will give you an option for password or to leave it as a default, and will return the generated password directly to your clipboard.

## Is it safe?

Well, it's made to be as random as I can with a few minutes of programming. I made this tool to help me create a password whenever I need to make some throwaway account, or for accounts that requires a password update very often. Honestly, it's just a simple, silly project. I don't take any responsability for any problems caused by the use (or misuse) of the outputs generated by this code, so be warned and use it on your own volition.

## Can I use your code?

Sure, go ahead. It's nothing to wirte home about, besides, I think you can come up with better code on your own. But, if you really want it, use it, incorporate it in your software, make a buck, I don't care. Intelectual property is a fake thing created by phony people.
